# Clustering for Diversification analysis
Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.

Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features.

In financial Markets, Cluster analysis is a technique used to group sets of objects that share similar characteristics. It is common in statistics, but investors will use the approach to build a diversified portfolio. Stocks that exhibit high correlations in returns fall into one basket, those slightly less correlated in another, and so on, until each stock is placed into a category.

# Problem Statements
6.1 Create a table/data frame with the closing prices of 30 different stocks, with 10 from each of the caps

6.2 Calculate average annual percentage return and volatility of all 30 stocks over a theoretical one year period

6.3 Cluster the 30 stocks according to their mean annual Volatilities and Returns using K-means clustering. Identify the optimum number of clusters using the Elbow curve method

6.4 Prepare a separate Data frame to show which stocks belong to the same cluster
